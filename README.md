# Shared Activity Memory

Two simple [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda) functions that help people with *Alzheimer-Disease* to *remember* stuff about their *relatives and friends*.


Our Skill helps in this kind of situations:
- If you can't remember the names of your children or their age
- If you have problems remembering birthdates
- If you want to be up to date with the current statuses of your relatives or friends for example
    - their current place of living
    - their current job
    - their family-members
    - their relationship status
- If you forget your personal informations
